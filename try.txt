Clinical depression is a psychiatric mood disorder, caused by an individual’s difficulty in coping with stressful life events, and presents persistent feelings of sadness, nega- tivity and difficulty coping with everyday responsibilities. In 2002 the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed
unipolar depression as the fourth most significant cause of disability worldwide, and predicted it will be the second leading cause by 2030 (Mathers and Loncar, 2006). Olesen et al. (2012) estimated that in 2010 the cost per patient of depression in Europe was €24,000 (in terms of relative value assessed across 30 European countries) and the total cost of depression in the European Union was €92 billion,

with €54 billion of this cost due to lost work productivity. Similarly in the United States, Stewart et al. (2003) esti- mated that in 2002, workers with depression cost the U.S. economy $44 billion in lost productivity (due either to absence from work or reduced performance), an increase of $31 billion when compared to the lost productivity costs for U.S. workers without depression.
Suicide is the result of a deliberate self-inflicted act undertaken with the intent to end one’s life. Recently WHO estimated that over 800,000 people die from suicide every year and there are at least 20 times more attempted suicides (World Health Organisation, 2014). Often a pri- vate act, suicide has a profound negative impact on lives of those left behind; it is estimated that a single suicide intimately affects at least 6 other people (McIntosh, 2009). Despite the high socio-economic costs inflicted onto affected individuals, families and communities it remains a misunderstood and under-researched cause of death.
Depression often places an individual at higher risk of engaging in suicidal behaviours (Hawton et al., 2013; Le ́pineandBriley,2011).Ithasbeenestimatedthatup to 50% of individuals who commit suicide meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a depressive illness (Joiner et al., 2005; McGirr et al., 2007). Given the associations between depression and suicide, effective diagnosis and treatment of depression has been identified as a key strat- egy in suicide prevention (Mann et al., 2005). Specific screening for suicide risk should also be undertaken for all individuals undergoing assessment or treatment for depression (Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009).
As there is no single clinical characterisation of a suici- dal or depressed individual; this makes the diagnosis of both suicide risk and depression subjective in nature and time consuming. Gold-standard diagnostic and assessment tools for depression and suicidality remain rooted, almost exclusively, on the opinion of individual clinicians risking a range of subjective biases. Commonly used diagnostic tools include interview style assessment such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960) and Suicide Probability Scales (Cull and Gill, 1982). These assessments rate the severity of symptoms and beha- viours observed in depression or suicidality to give a patient a score which relates to their level of depression or suicide risk.
Diagnosis using this style of testing is complicated; it relies heavily on the ability, desire and honesty of a patient to communicate their symptoms, moods or cognitions when, by definition, their outlook and motivation are impaired. Therefore diagnostic information is time con- suming to gather and requires a large degree of clinical training, practice, and certification to produce acceptable results (Mundt et al., 2007). Currently there is no objective measure, with clinical utility, for either depression or suicidality; this compromises optimal patient care, com- pounding an already high burden on health, social, and economic services.
To enhance current diagnostic methods an objective screening mechanism, based on biological, physiological and behavioural signals is needed. A wide range of biologi- cal markers such as low serotonin levels (Nock et al., 2008; Sharp and Cowen, 2011), neurotransmitter dysfunction (Luscher et al., 2011; Poulter et al., 2008) and genetic abnormalities (Dwivedi et al., 2003; Gatt et al., 2009) have been associated with depression and suicidal behaviour, however to date no specific biomarker has been found. Whilst biomarkers remain elusive, significant recent advances have been made in using affective computing and social signal processing as a diagnostic tool, for depres- sion specifically (Cohn et al., 2009; Cummins et al., 2013c; Joshi et al., 2013; Scherer et al., 2013c; Williamson et al., 2013). These systems rely in particular on facial and body tracking algorithms to capture characteristic behavioural changes relating to depression.
In recent years, the problem of automatically detecting mental illness using speech, more specifically non-verbal paralinguistic cues has gained popularity. Speech is an attractive candidate for use in an automated system; it can be measured cheaply, remotely, non-invasively and non-intrusively. Clinicians often (subjectively) use the ver- bal behaviour of a patient during diagnosis; decreased ver- bal activity productivity, a diminished prosody and monotonous and “lifeless” sounding speech is indicative of depression (Hall et al., 1995; Sobin and Sackeim, 1997). Similarly it has been reported that as an individual becomes suicidal their speech quality changes to a hollow and toneless sound (Silverman, 1992).
Similar speech processing frameworks are likely to be effective when applied to assessment of either depression or suicide risk. Such a tool could be of great use in primary health care settings. Between 50% and 70% of individuals experiencing depression will consult their primary health care provider (Sikorski et al., 2012). However it has been estimated that General Practitioners have only a 50% suc- cess rate when diagnosing depressed individuals (Mitchell et al., 2009). Additional methods for early diagnosis could have a significant effect on suicide prevention, given that in up to 66% of suicides, patients have contacted a primary health care provider within a month prior to their death (Mann et al., 2005).
Whilst there has been significant research into cor- relations between prosodic, articulatory and acoustic fea- tures of speech and clinical ratings of both depression (Cummins et al., 2011; Flint et al., 1993; Low et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2008; Mundt et al., 2007; Nilsonne, 1988; Scherer et al., 2013b; Trevino et al., 2011; Williamson et al., 2013) and suicidality (Scherer et al., 2013a; Silverman and Silverman, 2006; Silverman, 1992) as well as work on the automatic analysis of speech as a predictor for both conditions (France et al., 2000; Ozdas et al., 2004a; Yingthawornsuk et al., 2007), there has never been an extensive review of this literature.
In order to investigate how speech might be used to index or classify depression or suicidality, it is necessary
